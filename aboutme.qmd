### Background and Training
I am a **first-year PhD student in Health Services Research**, with a background in **statistics**.
My academic training has provided me with experience in quantitative methods and data analysis, and I am particularly interested in applying these tools to real-world public health and policy questions.
### Research Interests
My research interests focus on **public health**, **healthcare access**, and **health policy equity**. I am especially interested in understanding how social, economic, and policy environments shape health outcomes and contribute to disparities across populations.
### Data Analysis and Programming Experience
I have previously used **R and Python** for data analysis and visualization. While I am still building confidence and fluency in these tools, I am comfortable working with data and eager to continue improving my programming and analytical skills.
### Goals for This Course
Through this course, I hope to strengthen my ability to conduct **reproducible data analyses**, gain more experience with modern data science tools, and further improve my proficiency in **R** for applied data analysis.
