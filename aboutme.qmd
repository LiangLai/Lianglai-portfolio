### Background and Training

I am a **first-year PhD student in Health Services Research**, with a background in **statistics**.
My academic training has provided me with experience in quantitative methods and data analysis, and I am particularly interested in applying these tools to real-world public health and policy questions.
### Research Interests

My research interests focus on **public health**, **healthcare access**, and **health policy equity**. I am especially interested in understanding how social, economic, and policy environments shape health outcomes and contribute to disparities across populations.
### Data Analysis and Programming Experience

I have previously used **R and Python** for data analysis and visualization. While I am still building confidence and fluency in these tools, I am comfortable working with data and eager to continue improving my programming and analytical skills.
### Goals for This Course

Through this course, I hope to strengthen my ability to conduct **reproducible data analyses**, gain more experience with modern data science tools, and further improve my proficiency in **R** for applied data analysis.

### 🔗 A Dataset I Have Been Working With

One dataset I have recently been working with is the **Health and Retirement Study (HRS)**, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of older adults in the United States.

I have been using HRS in recent research related to **dementia**, which has made me particularly familiar with the structure and variables of the dataset. I find HRS especially valuable because it provides rich longitudinal information on health, socioeconomic status, and aging, allowing for applied statistical analyses that are directly relevant to public health and health policy questions.
