# Data description

This dataset contains model-based county-level estimates in GIS-friendly format. PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels.

# Data clean
I select a small set of columns to keep the analysis focused: identifiers, state, county, fips, population size and several health measures (continuous prevalence estimates). 
```{r}
cdc <- cdc_raw %>%
  select(
    state = state_abbr,
    county = county_name,
    fips = county_fips,
    population = total_population,
    # Health measures (Crude Prevalence)
    diabetes = diabetes_crude_prev,
    obesity = obesity_crude_prev,
    depression = depression_crude_prev,
    smoking = csmoking_crude_prev,
    binge_drinking = binge_crude_prev
  )

glimpse(cdc)
```

We will drop rows when key variables are missing.
```{r}
# check data
colSums(is.na(cdc))

# drop rows if missing
cdc <- cdc %>%
  drop_na(diabetes, obesity, smoking, depression, binge_drinking)
```

```{r}
# check outliers
summary(cdc)
```

# Exploratory Analysis
PLACES is a county-level, wide-format dataset. The exploratory analyses below summarize the distribution of the key categorical variable and the marginal distributions of the selected continuous measures.
```{r}
# number of counties by state
cdc %>%
  count(state, sort = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n))

# Bar plot: counties per state
ggplot(cdc %>% count(state), aes(x = reorder(state, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Counties by State",
    x = "State",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```

County representation varies substantially by state. Texas has the largest number of counties by a wide margin, while several smaller states contribute relatively few.

```{r}
#  Summary of population 
skim(cdc$population)

# Histogram of population (log scale due to strong right skew)
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = population)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of County Population (Log Scale)",
    x = "Population (log10)",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```
County population is right-skewed (min ≈ 81; max ≈ 9,663,345), with the mean (≈ 107,384) much larger than the median (25,800).

```{r}
# Summary of Obesity (crude prevalence)
skim(cdc$obesity)

# Histogram of obesity prevalence
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = obesity)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Adult Obesity Prevalence (Crude)",
    x = "Obesity prevalence",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```
Adult obesity prevalence is approximately unimodal and fairly symmetric across counties, centered around 38%.

```{r}
# Summary of diabetes
skim(cdc$diabetes)

# Histogram of diabetes prevalence
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = diabetes)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Diabetes Prevalence (Crude)",
    x = "Diabetes prevalence",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```
Diabetes prevalence is centered around 13% (mean ≈ 13.6; median ≈ 13.3) and shows a mild right tail.

```{r}
# Summary of smoking
skim(cdc$smoking)

# Histogram of smoking prevalence
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = smoking)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Current Smoking Prevalence (Crude)",
    x = "Smoking prevalence",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```
Current smoking prevalence is concentrated around 15% and is slightly right-skewed.

```{r}
# Summary of depression
skim(cdc$depression)

# Histogram of depression prevalence
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = depression)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Depression Prevalence (Crude)",
    x = "Depression prevalence",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )
```
Depression prevalence is centered around the low-20% range, with most counties roughly between 20% and 26%.

```{r}
# Summary of binge drinking 
skim(cdc$binge_drinking)

# Histogram of binge drinking prevalence
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = binge_drinking)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Binge Drinking Prevalence (Crude)",
    x = "Binge drinking prevalence",
    y = "Number of counties"
  )

```
Binge drinking prevalence is fairly concentrated around 16%, with a moderate right tail.

```{r}
# Bivariate relationship: obesity vs diabetes

ggplot(cdc, aes(x = obesity, y = diabetes)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    title = "Obesity vs Diabetes (County Level)",
    x = "Obesity prevalence",
    y = "Diabetes prevalence"
  )
```
A positive relationship is expected, with higher obesity prevalence generally corresponding to higher diabetes prevalence
