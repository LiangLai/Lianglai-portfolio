    "text": "Background and Training\nI am a first-year PhD student in Health Services Research, with a background in statistics. My academic training has provided me with experience in quantitative methods and data analysis, and I am particularly interested in applying these tools to real-world public health and policy questions. ### Research Interests My research interests focus on public health, healthcare access, and health policy equity. I am especially interested in understanding how social, economic, and policy environments shape health outcomes and contribute to disparities across populations. ### Data Analysis and Programming Experience I have previously used R and Python for data analysis and visualization. While I am still building confidence and fluency in these tools, I am comfortable working with data and eager to continue improving my programming and analytical skills. ### Goals for This Course Through this course, I hope to strengthen my ability to conduct reproducible data analyses, gain more experience with modern data science tools, and further improve my proficiency in R for applied data analysis."
